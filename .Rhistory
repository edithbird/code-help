Good Afternoon Jon,
I wanted to follow up on the application flow for matriculated  \\
students in Online Programs. I matched the raw data you sent me from ME St \\
with the SF data to get the application timeline.\\
There's such a huge gap so I wanted you to double check it. \\
If it looks like you think it should, I'll proceed with my report.\\
